<p>We started looking at Scotch Collies in 2012 after we moved to Halcyon Lane Farm.

is one of the
<a href="http://heritage.scotchcollie.org" title="Heritage Kennels">Heritage</a>
dogs
and we were really excited to get in on a litter from
<a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/registry/browser.php?id=63528" title="Heritage Little Lassen">Lassen</a>
and
<a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/registry/browser.php?id=63492" title="Heritage Mighty Rainier">Rainier</a>
. We are members of the
<a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/" title="Old-Time Scotch Collie Association">Old-Time Scotch Collie Association</a>
and Jack is registered there.</p>

<p>It was an adventure getting Captain Jack in August of 2012 when we made a trip to Missouri as part of a "puppy train"
that started in Arizona and ended in Michigan.</p>
