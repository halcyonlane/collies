Early in 2026, we saw an ad for scotch collie puppies on a amish farm about an hour from us. Jack was getting pretty old by then and we were wanting a male to breed Annie before she got too old, so we decided to check out the ad. Four rolly polly darling puppies were there to greet us! The mother was very friendly and seemed to have no problem with us handling her babies, except that she wanted attention too! The owners were very helpful, and we got to meet the sire of the puppies, who lived just down the road. What a gorgeous boy! The puppy I was interested in was a male with a full white ruff around his neck, which I loved. We didn't want to commit to buying a puppy for sure just yet, but its hard to say no to a sweet bundle of fur that snuggles up to you. Less than a week later we were back to take him home. His name is Kip.
