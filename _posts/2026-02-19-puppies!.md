Annie and Kip have Puppies! Four darling little pups, two boys and two girls. They were born on February 13th/14th. All are all doing well. So is Annie! This is her first litter, but she is taking care of them like a pro. She has been good with us handling her babies, but makes is clear that she wants to be close when we hold them. There's not much that's cuter than four tiny tails wagging happily at feeding time! 

Meet the puppies:

## Myrtle (female)

**We often walk through its quiet, myrtle-bordered paths on our way to the other end of the village....**
<br/>
– Kate Douglas Wiggin, (Penelope's Experiences in Scotland).
