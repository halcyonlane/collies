The past two weeks have brought so many changes to the puppies, and it is amazing to
watch it all happen day by day. Their eyes have opened, they’ve begun to walk around,
and their noses have already begun to darken. We’ve also been seeing personalities come out
in each of the pups as they start to play with each other and with us
(they get A LOT of attention from us and our children).

We are accepting applications for adoption now.
[Email us](mailto:mindy@halcyonlane.com)
to get the process started,
or just to chat about the puppies.
If you have your eye on a particular one, choice is normally given in
the order reservations are made.

## Lucy Locket

   Lucy Locket lost her pocket, Kitty Fisher found it; 

   Not a penny was there in it, only ribbon round it.

## Margery Daw

   See-saw, Margery Daw, Johnny shall have a new master; 

   He shall have but a penny a day because he can’t work any faster.
