It’s been so exciting to see each puppy’s personality blossom.
Already I’m seeing so many of the strong Scotch Collie traits that have been part of the breed for centuries.
As I’ve spoken with people across the country about these puppies,
I keep hearing such wonderful stories from your histories, of collies that have
touched yours or your ancestors’ lives. I love being a part of bringing back this wonderful breed!

   Lucy Locket lost her pocket, Kitty Fisher found it;

   See-saw, Margery Daw, Johnny shall have a new master; 

   He shall have but a penny a day because he can’t work any faster.
