We’ve been training Jack to keep the goslings out of the back yard.
He is very enthusiastic about helping.
I think Jack’s highest motivator is praise from us.
When he does a good job he gives his collie smile and soaks in his reward.

When the goslings were still quite small yet, we were putting them in their
ranging pen. I noticed Lassie, who had been lying nearby,
get up and move a couple of feet over, then lie down. Then she did it again. I couldn’t figure out what she was doing until I realized that the family cat was coming close, and Lassie was deliberately placing herself in-between the cat and the goslings!

And not too much later, two goslings didn’t come home with the rest and I couldn’t find them anywhere.
I assumed they were at the creek still and was not going to worry about it. My mother-in-law told me to ask Jack where they were, but I didn’t think he would understand.
So, she took it upon herself to ask Jack where they were and followed him right to the empty silo where the goslings had trapped themselves!
It was really neat to see Jack do a classic collie rescue!
