We’ve decided to go with a Mother Goose nursery rhyme theme for naming this litter of puppies.
They are looking really healthy and growing fast. A couple have been trying to walk around, which is so hilarious.
Any day now, they should be opening their eyes, and then look out world.

Let’s get to know each puppy now, with some pictures and a rhyme!

## Anthony Rowley

   *With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach, “Heigho,” says Anthony Rowley!*

## Betsy Brooks

   As Tommy Snooks and Betsy Brooks were walking out one Sunday, 

   Said Tommy Snooks to Betsy Brooks, “Tomorrow will be Monday.”

## Bobby Shaftoe

   Bobby Shaftoe’s gone to sea, Silver buckles on his knee; 

   He’ll come back and marry me, Bonny Bobby Shaftoe!

## Charley Wag

   *Ate the pudding, and left the bag.*

## Jenny Wren

   ‘Twas once upon a time, when Jenny Wren was young, 

   So daintily she danced and so prettily she sung…

## Lucy Locket

   Lucy Locket lost her pocket, Kitty Fisher found it; 

   Not a penny was there in it, only ribbon round it.

## Margery Daw

   See-saw, Margery Daw, Johnny shall have a new master; 

   He shall have but a penny a day because he can’t work any faster.

## Nancy Etticoat

   Little Nancy Etticoat in a white petticoat and a red nose; 

   The longer she stands the shorter she grows.

## Polly Flinders

   Little Polly Flinders sat among the cinders, 

   warming her pretty little toes.
