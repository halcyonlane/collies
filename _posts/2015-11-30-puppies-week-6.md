We’ve been giving the pups some daily excursions outside to play. They love getting outside and exploring the sights and smells of the farm as well as making friends with some of the cats.

Captain Jack has not been nearly as terrified of his progeny this litter as he was for his first. He likes to play with the pups a little bit, but Lassie keeps him in line. We are going to miss these little guys but know they are going to some great new homes!
