The puppies are now eleven days old and have grown a lot. They are trying to walk and their eyes are starting to open, but they can't see much yet. The newborn stage went by so fast! Annie has been leaving them alone for longer periods of time now, and we get more puppy holding time.

## Myrtle (female)

**We often walk through its quiet, myrtle-bordered paths on our way to the other end of the village....**
<br/>
– Kate Douglas Wiggin, (Penelope's Experiences in Scotland).
