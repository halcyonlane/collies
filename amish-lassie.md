<p>We purchased
<a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/registry/browser.php?id=63793" title="Halcyon Amish Lassie">Amish Lassie</a>
from a local Amish family in September of 2013. She is registered with the
<a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/" title="Old-Time Scotch Collie Association">Old-Time Scotch Collie Association</a>,
of which we are members.</p>

<p>Finding Lassie was very exciting because she comes from potentially very old lines in the Amish community
(we are still working on getting more information, but the Amish do not register their dogs, and can
also be very private about sharing information). Still, it seems that some Amish people around here have carried on
a line of working farm collies that we are really excited to have discovered.
Introducing these lines into the
<a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/" title="Old-Time Scotch Collie Association">Old-Time Scotch Collie Association</a>
by pairing her with
<a href="/captain-jack/" title="Heritage Captain Jack">Captain Jack</a> will help keep the gene pool strong and healthy.</p>

<p><a href="/captain-jack/" title="Heritage Captain Jack">Captain Jack</a>
and Lassie get along really well and it's fun to see them running around the farm together, chasing mice,
herding the poultry to their designated areas, or bringing the cows in for milking.</p>
