<!--I'm still working on arranging a video of Lassie meeting a stranger coming to our house - I'll get that to you when I can. -->


<!--This week we're going to be putting our cow outside again, so I'll be able to get video of Lassie around her. -->




<!--I know we covered a lot of this on our phone conversation, but here it is in writing, in case it's helpful!-->




<!--After I started reading about Scotch Collies, I was reminded of a farm dog I had seen while visiting a local Amish business (located on their farm). -->


<!--Something about her affection and understanding of her master stuck with me. I haven't been able to see that dog since, but I left a message with them -->


<!--later that I was interested in getting a dog like her.-->




<!--A couple of months later I saw an ad in the local rural newspaper. -->


<!--It was for collie/heeler puppies and only listed an address, so I knew they were probably Amish. -->


<!--Hoping to see the dog that was the collie part, I drove out to the Borntragers' place. As soon as I saw Lassie, I thought collie.-->


<!--Mrs. Borntrager explained that the father of the puppies was a neighbor's heeler. She gave me permission to take pictures of Lassie and her puppies.-->


<!--She said she named her Lassie after the book (of course). When asked if Lassie herds any animals around the farm, -->


<!--Mrs. Borntrager replied, "Oh, yah, she brings the cows in." She said her biggest fault is that she was too friendly with strangers. -->


<!--Blue Heelers would be more protective, she said. Lassie certainly did seem to crave and appreciate attention! -->


<!--On their farm they had 8 or so milk cows and raised layer chickens, along with a pony and I'm not sure what else. -->


<!--Their children were all young, so I knew Lassie was used to kids!-->




<!--Mrs. Borntrager didn't know anything of Lassie's background, just said that "someone in our community raises them." -->


<!--On our final visit, when Mr. Borntrager was there, he said that he got her from his uncle. He couldn't tell me anything about Lassie's parents, -->


<!--except that her mother had been black and white. Mrs. Borntrager had seemed very hesitant when I mentioned wanting to visit the person who bred Lassie, -->


<!--so I never pushed that. -->




<!--Anyway, after that visit, Lassie lingered in my mind as a Scotch Collie potential.  -->


<!--A couple of months later, I got a phone call from the original Amish business I had left a message with that they knew of some puppies available at another farm. -->


<!--I drove out there, and saw a dog that seemed to have collie in her, too, a tricolor. But she wasn't as definitively collie to me. -->


<!--Her puppies were the offspring of a neighbor's heeler as well (this was several miles from the Borntragers' farm). I requested permission to take pictures. -->


<!--I told them that I was looking for a dog that had more of the straight collie. I mentioned Borntragers' Lassie, and the man got a funny look on his face. -->


<!--He said, "Our dog is actually her daughter!" -->




<!--This again intrigued me about Lassie, and since I was already out driving, I decided to stop by Borntragers' again. -->


<!--This started a conversation that took several months, since Mrs. Borntrager wanted to check back in with her husband each time -->


<!--(I never happened to stop by when he was home), we couldn't communicate by phone, and I didn't want to bother them too much!  -->


<!--During this time I was starting the process of applying for Jack's full registration, so had talked with Deb Carsey on the phone. -->


<!--I mentioned Lassie and she said I should send her pictures. You'll see that in the email conversation I forwarded to you. -->




<!--Finally it was decided that we could try to arrange a breeding between Lassie and Jack. And Lassie had a litter of collie/heeler puppies again, -->


<!--this time with a beautiful little tricolor and again, a couple others with straight collie markings. We didn't know how to arrange it well, -->


<!--so Tony and I talked it over and decided to feel them out about buying Lassie. I felt horrible even mentioning it, since Lassie was their family's dog. -->


<!--But, if they were interested.... When I first mentioned it to Mrs. Borntrager she said that her husband had already said that with her missing foot, -->


<!--her getting older, and the fact that they could conveniently keep one of the puppies she had now, it would be fine to sell her. -->


<!--(Side note: when we went to pick her up, they told us she was four. So I'm not sure if she really was older than that or not, since they mentioned her "getting older." -->


<!--She certainly had a rough enough life that I had assumed she was pretty old!) We arranged to pick her up the following Saturday, and then we could -->


<!--meet Mr. Borntrager as well.-->




<!--Mr. Borntrager told Tony that just that week Lassie had really helped him move a bull that he couldn't get to move. -->


<!--He also explained about her foot, that a couple of years before she had gotten tangled up in a haycutter accident, and lost the foot. -->


<!--The following Monday, after seeing her, the vet said she said thought she had received trauma to her teeth as well. -->


<!--One of Lassie's ears is torn a little, too. Mr. Borntrager said that she'd eat anything, they just fed her scraps and dog food only when she was nursing puppies.-->




<!--When we got home, I was really worried that Lassie might try to return to her family, about 12 miles away. She really seemed to appreciate the -->


<!--food and treats and almost just as much the affection we gave her! She seemed responsive to the tones of our voices, and especially our hand signals -->


<!--if we waved an arm in the direction we wanted her to go. I had forgotten to ask the Borntragers what commands she knew (not that they would have been -->


<!--in English, but I could have tried!)  -->




<!--The next morning when we were out milking, Lassie wanted to be in the barn with us. Since our cow wasn't used to her, though, we left Lassie outside, -->


<!--just for the couple of minutes it would take. Lassie didn't seem to want to leave us, so we thought it'd be fine. That was a huge mistake, what was I -->


<!--thinking??!! When I came outside, Lassie was gone. We asked Jack where she was, and he seemed to sniff his way toward the pasture next to a cornfield, -->


<!--which would have been toward her old home. But of course we didn't know if he knew what we were asking. The next 3 hours were agonizing. I drove county -->


<!--road after county road. The edge of the cornfields were a tangle that I didn't think she'd be able to navigate well, with her 3 feet. So that left along -->


<!--the roads or between the rows of the fields. We had had a tag made for her the week before we got her, and she was so friendly I hoped somebody might call. -->


<!--Finally, I came home. Not too long after, about 3 hours after she had been missing, my mom called, "Here's Lassie!" She came running from the corn field, all muddy, -->


<!--but very happy to see us!  I wonder if she attempted to go "home" but gave up after getting tired. -->




<!--Since then, she really seemed to accept us as her new family and home. She does great with the kids. She was not sure about Jack at all, at first, -->


<!--but now she does very well. She'll lick him when they're hanging out together, and when he attempts often enough, she'll play with him, too!  -->


<!--She's done very well with the boundaries we've established for her. The Borntragers had only kept her outside so I wasn't sure how she'd do in the house. -->


<!--She's done perfectly. Like I said before, she seems to let Jack take the protective role, but if he's not around, she takes it upon herself. -->


<!--She had a couple of times near the beginning where she tested our dog boundaries (smaller than our property boundaries!), but after we made it clear that -->


<!--wasn't acceptable, she has not crossed them since!-->




<!--She does well with our free range chickens and cats, and the cow and her calf, too. But she does seem the most oriented toward Tony and I, -->


<!--and what we want, when we're outside.-->




<!--I've given the attributes in her that I think line up with her being a Scotch Collie in my previous email for her application. -->


<!--If there are any strikes against her in that regard, I think it would be that she could be overly-friendly and she does seem to have more of a -->


<!--doggie smell than Jack ever does. Her coat is not as long as Jack's, certainly, but it seems to have more of the double-coated rough guard hairs and -->


<!--soft under-hairs than his does, too. Jack is always really good about his food, but Lassie has a tendency to overeat. At the start she scarfed down anything -->


<!--we gave her. But when she seemed to realize that we'd provide her the food she needed, she relaxed more about that. Lately, she's put on more weight -->


<!--(before she was pregnant). The vet said to really watch that, since it'd be more of a strain with her missing foot, so we've been rationing her. -->
