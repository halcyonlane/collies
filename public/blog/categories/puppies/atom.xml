<p>Spring has really sprung here at Halcyon Lane Farm. We&rsquo;ve been hatching out ducks, turkeys, chickens and geese, waiting for a couple calves, setting up a new beehive, planting fruit trees, <em>and</em> oh yeah, Lassie just had puppies! There are 5 roly-poly cute puppies, 4 sables (2 male, 2 female) and 1 tricolor (female). Everything went well and all the puppies are healthy and thriving.</p>

<p>We are accepting applications for pups, but several are already reserved, so if any of these sweethearts tickle your fancy, contact us sooner rather than later :)</p>

<p>We are still working on names (just haven&rsquo;t had a spare minute for fun stuff like that!), but like always, we&rsquo;ll try to keep the updates coming as they grow and are placed in their new homes!</p>

<p>This is our last week with the puppies before they leave us and head off to their new homes. We are sure going to miss them! At the same time, the pups are very anxious to meet you (you know who you are!) and are practically gift wrapping themselves to get home for Christmas.</p>

<p>This week will be their first visit to the vet, so they can have their clean bill of health before heading out into the world, all full of adventure.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been giving the pups some daily excursions outside to play. They love getting outside and exploring the sights and smells of the farm as well as making friends with some of the cats.</p>

<p>Captain Jack has not been nearly as terrified of his progeny this litter as he was for his first. He likes to play with the pups a little bit, but Lassie keeps him in line. We are going to miss these little guys but know they are going to some great new homes!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been having a blast giving so much holding time and attention to all four pups and taking them outside for their first romps. They&rsquo;ve loved the time outside and it&rsquo;s great watching them take in all the new scents and sights.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve really seemed to desire our companionship more and more, especially as Lassie is beginning to spend more time away. She&rsquo;s a good experienced mama, and we go by her pace for when she wants time away or time with the pups.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve introduced toys. It&rsquo;s hilarious now, just watching them play. Of course, one of them always wants to be sleeping while a couple others trample the sleeper to start some fun.</p>

<p>The puppies are doing well and growing leaps and bounds.
Their eyes and ears are open, they&rsquo;re learning to walk (pretty hilarious), and ready to meet the world.</p>

<p>Their coats are just beginning to show signs of longer vs shorter hair, but that will come out more
in the next couple weeks. We&rsquo;re also just getting a glimpse into the personalities of the pups.</p>
