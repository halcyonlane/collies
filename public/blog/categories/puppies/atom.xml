<p>Hot summer days, the garden is in, apples are grafted, and puppies are on the run! The weather has been so beautiful, we&rsquo;ve been taking the puppies outside for extra play times.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so fun to watch them trot around, alert to any changes since the last time they were out. They have some good tussles and play follow-the-leader. One puppy will find an interesting thing to carry around and runs to keep it from the others. After a while, one-by-one the puppies plop down in a cozy spot for a nap. Then we scoop them up and take them back to the house for a long nap.</p>

<p>All the puppies are now reserved, and we&rsquo;re really excited about the families they are going to. Check out our

<p>Things are going swimmingly with this litter of puppies. They are growing up really fast and we&rsquo;re getting to the stage where personalities are starting to bloom, which is so fun! The newborn wobbly legs have turned into strong healthy ones that like to wrestle, tackle, jump and run around.</p>

<p>We took these last pictures outside on one of those ideal days: Sunday of Memorial Day weekend with blue skies, white puffy clouds and the family playing croquet out on the front lawn. It was the first time the puppies had extended time to play and romp outside like that. The kids, as always, are doing a great job of giving each pup a lot of TLC. Now that the puppies are older and have more energy we are going to be giving them their daily dose of outside play time.</p>

<p>Four puppies are officially reserved now, and we have a general idea on which ones they are, but still haven&rsquo;t worked out which puppy goes to which person (if you are one of those people, and you know who you are, we&rsquo;ll be contacting you soon to finalize).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a little busier than usual around our place, and getting consensus on names for the puppies has been about as difficult as finding time to post an update of them :)  (Scroll down for pictures)</p>

<p>The puppies have been growing fast and Lassie has been ravenously hungry. Coincidence? I think not. They are 2 weeks old now and their eyes have just started opening for the first time. What an exciting time, wondering what it must be like for them to peek out into this world they&rsquo;ve only so far smelled, touched and tasted.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a special time for us and our children, because we are pretty sure this will be the last time we breed Jack and Lassie. That&rsquo;s right, no more Halcyon pups in the forseeable future. We don&rsquo;t know all the history of Lassie&rsquo;s past, but she didn&rsquo;t have an easy life before we found her, and we think this decision will be good for her.</p>

<p>We had 3 accepted applications from our waiting list almost right away, so only 2 pups are left to be reserved. I decided to hold off on reserving the last two for a little while, just to let the dust settle. One of the tricky parts of reserving pups this early is that we don&rsquo;t know for sure about coat length or personalities, etc.</p>

<p>Without further ado, introducing&hellip;.</p>

<p>Spring has really sprung here at Halcyon Lane Farm. We&rsquo;ve been hatching out ducks, turkeys, chickens and geese, waiting for a couple calves, setting up a new beehive, planting fruit trees, <em>and</em> oh yeah, Lassie just had puppies! There are 5 roly-poly cute puppies, 4 sables (2 male, 2 female) and 1 tricolor (female). Everything went well and all the puppies are healthy and thriving.</p>

<p>We are accepting applications for pups, but several are already reserved, so if any of these sweethearts tickle your fancy, contact us sooner rather than later :)</p>

<p>We are still working on names (just haven&rsquo;t had a spare minute for fun stuff like that!), but like always, we&rsquo;ll try to keep the updates coming as they grow and are placed in their new homes!</p>

<p>This is our last week with the puppies before they leave us and head off to their new homes. We are sure going to miss them! At the same time, the pups are very anxious to meet you (you know who you are!) and are practically gift wrapping themselves to get home for Christmas.</p>

<p>This week will be their first visit to the vet, so they can have their clean bill of health before heading out into the world, all full of adventure.</p>
