<p>Announcing, born to Heritage Captain Jack and Halcyon Amish Lassie,
 on Sunday September 7th, lots of puppies. They were born all through the
night Sunday and into Monday morning, ending up with 9 puppies overall.</p>

<p>There are 6 females and 3 males, all with gorgeous sausage-like bodies.
They look so healthy and chubby! Our children will be holding these puppies
a lot. Lassie does not seem to mind us being around and holding some
puppies now and then, but when she is outside for a break,
 we all pounce and scoop them up for holding time.</p>

<p>Here is a picture (more to follow) with Lassie and the pups:</p>

<p>As soon as we decide on names we will send in our litter registration to the
<a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/" title="Old-Time Scotch Collie Association">Old-Time Scotch Collie Association</a>.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:mindy@halcyonlane.com">Send us an email</a>
  if you are interested in one of these pups!</p>

<p>We took Lassie to the vet two weeks ago and she was diagnosed with puppies!
When Lassie was on the Amish farm, she usually had big litters of 8 to 12 pups.
We&rsquo;ll see if that holds true, and if so, we could be in for a lot of fun around our place.
She is due in early September.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been really excited to see how to combination of Jack and Lassie will turn out.
Lassie introduces an entirely new blood line to the <a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/," title="Old Time Scotch Collie Association">OTSCA</a> registry, and she is a really special dog. Jack brings a great pedigree to the mix, so hopefully
there will be some fantastic puppies to share with the Scotch Collie community soon.</p>

<p>To be placed on our puppy waiting list,
<a href="mailto:mindy@halcyonlane.com">send us an email</a>
with the subject line &ldquo;Gotta have one!&rdquo; and tell us a little about yourself.</p>
