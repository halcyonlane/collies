<p>We&rsquo;ve been giving the pups some daily excursions outside to play. They love getting outside and exploring the sights and smells of the farm as well as making friends with some of the cats.</p>

<p>Captain Jack has not been nearly as terrified of his progeny this litter as he was for his first. He likes to play with the pups a little bit, but Lassie keeps him in line. We are going to miss these little guys but know they are going to some great new homes!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been having a blast giving so much holding time and attention to all four pups and taking them outside for their first romps. They&rsquo;ve loved the time outside and it&rsquo;s great watching them take in all the new scents and sights.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve really seemed to desire our companionship more and more, especially as Lassie is beginning to spend more time away. She&rsquo;s a good experienced mama, and we go by her pace for when she wants time away or time with the pups.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve introduced toys. It&rsquo;s hilarious now, just watching them play. Of course, one of them always wants to be sleeping while a couple others trample the sleeper to start some fun.</p>

<p>The puppies are doing well and growing leaps and bounds.
Their eyes and ears are open, they&rsquo;re learning to walk (pretty hilarious), and ready to meet the world.</p>

<p>Their coats are just beginning to show signs of longer vs shorter hair, but that will come out more
in the next couple weeks. We&rsquo;re also just getting a glimpse into the personalities of the pups.</p>

<p>Announcing, born to Heritage Captain Jack and Halcyon Amish Lassie, on Friday October 16th, 5 puppies! Lassie woke us up at about 1:45am and we came down to find a puppy born. There was not much sleep to be had the rest of the night, too exciting! By 7:00am there were 5 puppies.</p>

<p>We found out that Jack and Lassie both carry the tri-color trait, which also surprised us since all 9 puppies last time were sables. Of the 5 pups in this litter, 3 were tri-color and 2 sable. Sadly, the smallest tri-color pup died at a few days old. So there are four pups up for adoption, 3 females and 1 male. We probably won&rsquo;t know which are smooth vs rough coat until the puppies are about 3 weeks old.</p>

<p>It was somewhat of an adventure learning Lassie was going to have a litter of puppies this year. We had her tested about 5 weeks ago, and the test came back negative. But it became pretty obvious of late that the test was just wrong this time :)</p>

<p>And now to meet the puppies!</p>

litter are now home for the holidays. It has been fun to hear from their new owners and we&rsquo;ll continue to watch with interest
