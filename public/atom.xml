<p>Hot summer days, the garden is in, apples are grafted, and puppies are on the run! The weather has been so beautiful, we&rsquo;ve been taking the puppies outside for extra play times.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so fun to watch them trot around, alert to any changes since the last time they were out. They have some good tussles and play follow-the-leader. One puppy will find an interesting thing to carry around and runs to keep it from the others. After a while, one-by-one the puppies plop down in a cozy spot for a nap. Then we scoop them up and take them back to the house for a long nap.</p>

<p>All the puppies are now reserved, and we&rsquo;re really excited about the families they are going to. Check out our facebook page for bonus pictures!</p>

<p>Things are going swimmingly with this litter of puppies. They are growing up really fast and we&rsquo;re getting to the stage where personalities are starting to bloom, which is so fun! The newborn wobbly legs have turned into strong healthy ones that like to wrestle, tackle, jump and run around.</p>

<p>We took these last pictures outside on one of those ideal days: Sunday of Memorial Day weekend with blue skies, white puffy clouds and the family playing croquet out on the front lawn. It was the first time the puppies had extended time to play and romp outside like that. The kids, as always, are doing a great job of giving each pup a lot of TLC. Now that the puppies are older and have more energy we are going to be giving them their daily dose of outside play time.</p>

<p>Four puppies are officially reserved now, and we have a general idea on which ones they are, but still haven&rsquo;t worked out which puppy goes to which person (if you are one of those people, and you know who you are, we&rsquo;ll be contacting you soon to finalize).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a little busier than usual around our place, and getting consensus on names for the puppies has been about as difficult as finding time to post an update of them :)  (Scroll down for pictures)</p>

<p>The puppies have been growing fast and Lassie has been ravenously hungry. Coincidence? I think not. They are 2 weeks old now and their eyes have just started opening for the first time. What an exciting time, wondering what it must be like for them to peek out into this world they&rsquo;ve only so far smelled, touched and tasted.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a special time for us and our children, because we are pretty sure this will be the last time we breed Jack and Lassie. That&rsquo;s right, no more Halcyon pups in the forseeable future. We don&rsquo;t know all the history of Lassie&rsquo;s past, but she didn&rsquo;t have an easy life before we found her, and we think this decision will be good for her.</p>

<p>We had 3 accepted applications from our waiting list almost right away, so only 2 pups are left to be reserved. I decided to hold off on reserving the last two for a little while, just to let the dust settle. One of the tricky parts of reserving pups this early is that we don&rsquo;t know for sure about coat length or personalities, etc.</p>

<p>Without further ado, introducing&hellip;.</p>

<p>Spring has really sprung here at Halcyon Lane Farm. We&rsquo;ve been hatching out ducks, turkeys, chickens and geese, waiting for a couple calves, setting up a new beehive, planting fruit trees, <em>and</em> oh yeah, Lassie just had puppies! There are 5 roly-poly cute puppies, 4 sables (2 male, 2 female) and 1 tricolor (female). Everything went well and all the puppies are healthy and thriving.</p>

<p>We are accepting applications for pups, but several are already reserved, so if any of these sweethearts tickle your fancy, contact us sooner rather than later :)</p>

<p>We are still working on names (just haven&rsquo;t had a spare minute for fun stuff like that!), but like always, we&rsquo;ll try to keep the updates coming as they grow and are placed in their new homes!</p>

<p>This is our last week with the puppies before they leave us and head off to their new homes. We are sure going to miss them! At the same time, the pups are very anxious to meet you (you know who you are!) and are practically gift wrapping themselves to get home for Christmas.</p>

<p>This week will be their first visit to the vet, so they can have their clean bill of health before heading out into the world, all full of adventure.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been giving the pups some daily excursions outside to play. They love getting outside and exploring the sights and smells of the farm as well as making friends with some of the cats.</p>

<p>Captain Jack has not been nearly as terrified of his progeny this litter as he was for his first. He likes to play with the pups a little bit, but Lassie keeps him in line. We are going to miss these little guys but know they are going to some great new homes!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been having a blast giving so much holding time and attention to all four pups and taking them outside for their first romps. They&rsquo;ve loved the time outside and it&rsquo;s great watching them take in all the new scents and sights.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve really seemed to desire our companionship more and more, especially as Lassie is beginning to spend more time away. She&rsquo;s a good experienced mama, and we go by her pace for when she wants time away or time with the pups.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve introduced toys. It&rsquo;s hilarious now, just watching them play. Of course, one of them always wants to be sleeping while a couple others trample the sleeper to start some fun.</p>

<p>The puppies are doing well and growing leaps and bounds.
Their eyes and ears are open, they&rsquo;re learning to walk (pretty hilarious), and ready to meet the world.</p>

<p>Their coats are just beginning to show signs of longer vs shorter hair, but that will come out more
in the next couple weeks. We&rsquo;re also just getting a glimpse into the personalities of the pups.</p>

<p>Announcing, born to Heritage Captain Jack and Halcyon Amish Lassie, on Friday October 16th, 5 puppies! Lassie woke us up at about 1:45am and we came down to find a puppy born. There was not much sleep to be had the rest of the night, too exciting! By 7:00am there were 5 puppies.</p>

<p>We found out that Jack and Lassie both carry the tri-color trait, which also surprised us since all 9 puppies last time were sables. Of the 5 pups in this litter, 3 were tri-color and 2 sable. Sadly, the smallest tri-color pup died at a few days old. So there are four pups up for adoption, 3 females and 1 male. We probably won&rsquo;t know which are smooth vs rough coat until the puppies are about 3 weeks old.</p>

<p>It was somewhat of an adventure learning Lassie was going to have a litter of puppies this year. We had her tested about 5 weeks ago, and the test came back negative. But it became pretty obvious of late that the test was just wrong this time :)</p>

<p>And now to meet the puppies!</p>

<p>2014 was an eventful year for us at Halcyon Lane Farm, especially concerning the collies. We had our first litter of pups and placed them all into great new homes. We learned so much about our dogs this year as well. One of those lessons was to trust Jack and Lassie more.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting how quickly I jumped to conclusions when one of our dogs exhibited &ldquo;uncharacteristic&rdquo; behavior. Usually the conclusion was to assume Jack or Lassie was misbehaving, when in fact they had a good explanation.</p>

<p>For example, this summer, while we were away from home for a few hours we left Jack on guard duty. He keeps predators away from the flock while we are gone, and also keeps the chickens and geese out of the yard (that way the kids can still play barefoot). Upon our return, we were surprised to see Jack seemingly pinning a chicken down on the yard. We were shocked! Tony yelled from the car, &ldquo;Jack! What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My first thought was that Jack had been overzealous in his guard duty keeping the chickens out of the yard and had injured one. As Jack came over to us, we saw the chicken stumbling around, apparently wounded by Jack. Our son went over to assess the poor chicken&rsquo;s condition, but brought it over to us laughing. String was tangled all around both feet, but other than that the chicken was looking fine and healthy. After we removed the string and waited for the poor bird to realize he was free (chickens are not as smart as Scotch Collies), he walked back to the coop.</p>

<p>Poor Jack! We mistrusted him based on what we saw from a distance instead of giving him the benefit of the doubt. Jack was probably trying to communicate to us, &ldquo;Something is really wrong with this weird chicken,&rdquo; and it certainly needed to be brought to our attention. We changed our tune and Jack became the hero.</p>

<p>Later that summer, Lassie had a similar incident. My oldest son saw her rounding the chicken coop, chasing the ducks and geese, nipping right at their heels. He was very surprised and ran over to see what was happening. Come to find out, our biggest goose had started to chase our younger son, so Lassie was coming to the rescue! She didn&rsquo;t intend to hurt them at all, just teach them a lesson about what the pecking order was around the farm.</p>

<p>Looking back on this year, these are a couple of the lessons that have helped us understand and trust our dogs more. They really have proven that they deserve our trust. They are also showing that they want to understand us better and what we want from them in their role here on the farm.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ve really enjoyed having Anthony Rowley these extra few weeks, and haven&rsquo;t made too big of an effort to try and place him. But, he is now 13 weeks old and we know he will be better off getting to his new home sooner rather than later. For the last 3 weeks, we&rsquo;ve been getting to know him really well and are very pleased with his personality. He is very biddable and responds well to a gentle &ldquo;no&rdquo; followed by praise. That is how he has been learning what he can and cannot chew on around the house.</p>

<p>He also loves to hang out with us around the fireplace and will sleep there in the evenings.</p>

<p>He gets that warm, cozy, comfort seeking side from his dam, Lassie. Whereas, Captain Jack is fond of the snow and the cold, Lassie and Anthony Rowley are much quicker to come back in when the playing is finished.</p>

<p>We keep him in a kennel in our room at night, which has been going very well. We hear nary a peep from him from bedtime until we get up in the morning. He has also been traveling with us a few times as we visit family and has done really well.</p>

<p>House training has been going well, and with the other dogs around to help show him where to do his business, it makes things easier.</p>

<p>Let us know if you are interested in this handsome and affectionate little guy!</p>

<p>The puppies are now 8 weeks old, and those not spoken-for are ready to go to new homes!
They have really grown during the past two weeks and are delightfully fun. They&rsquo;re adventurous and playful when outdoors,
mellow and relaxed in-between times, and getting cuter every day!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been so exciting to see each puppy&rsquo;s personality blossom.
Already I&rsquo;m seeing so many of the strong Scotch Collie traits that have been part of the breed for centuries.
As I&rsquo;ve spoken with people across the country about these puppies,
I keep hearing such wonderful stories from your histories, of collies that have
touched yours or your ancestors&#8217; lives. I love being a part of bringing back this wonderful breed!</p>

<p>The past two weeks have brought so many changes to the puppies, and it is amazing to
watch it all happen day by day. Their eyes have opened, they&rsquo;ve begun to walk around,
and their noses have already begun to darken. We&rsquo;ve also been seeing personalities come out
in each of the pups as they start to play with each other and with us
(they get A LOT of attention from us and our children).</p>

<p>We are accepting applications for adoption now.
<a href="mailto:mindy@halcyonlane.com">Email us</a>
to get the process started,
or just to chat about the puppies.
If you have your eye on a particular one, choice is normally given in
the order reservations are made.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve decided to go with a Mother Goose nursery rhyme theme for naming this litter of puppies.
They are looking really healthy and growing fast. A couple have been trying to walk around, which is so hilarious.
Any day now, they should be opening their eyes, and then look out world.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to know each puppy now, with some pictures and a rhyme!</p>

<p>Announcing, born to Heritage Captain Jack and Halcyon Amish Lassie,
 on Sunday September 7th, lots of puppies. They were born all through the
night Sunday and into Monday morning, ending up with 9 puppies overall.</p>

<p>There are 6 females and 3 males, all with gorgeous sausage-like bodies.
They look so healthy and chubby! Our children will be holding these puppies
a lot. Lassie does not seem to mind us being around and holding some
puppies now and then, but when she is outside for a break,
 we all pounce and scoop them up for holding time.</p>

<p>Here is a picture (more to follow) with Lassie and the pups:</p>

<p><img src="http://collies.halcyonlane.com/images/lassie-with-puppies-1.jpg" width="600" title="Lassie With Pups" alt="Lassie with pups"></p>

<p>As soon as we decide on names we will send in our litter registration to the
<a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/" title="Old-Time Scotch Collie Association">Old-Time Scotch Collie Association</a>.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:mindy@halcyonlane.com">Send us an email</a>
  if you are interested in one of these pups!</p>

<p>We took Lassie to the vet two weeks ago and she was diagnosed with puppies!
When Lassie was on the Amish farm, she usually had big litters of 8 to 12 pups.
We&rsquo;ll see if that holds true, and if so, we could be in for a lot of fun around our place.
She is due in early September.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been really excited to see how the combination of Jack and Lassie will turn out.
Lassie introduces an entirely new blood line to the <a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/," title="Old Time Scotch Collie Association">OTSCA</a> registry, and she is a really special dog. Jack brings a great pedigree to the mix, so hopefully
there will be some fantastic puppies to share with the Scotch Collie community soon.</p>

<p>To be placed on our puppy waiting list,
<a href="mailto:mindy@halcyonlane.com">send us an email</a>
with the subject line &ldquo;Gotta have one!&rdquo; and tell us a little about yourself.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been training Jack to keep the goslings out of the back yard.
He is very enthusiastic about helping.
I think Jack&rsquo;s highest motivator is praise from us.
When he does a good job he gives his collie smile and soaks in his reward.</p>

<p>When the goslings were still quite small yet, we were putting them in their
ranging pen. I noticed Lassie, who had been lying nearby,
get up and move a couple of feet over, then lie down. Then she did it again. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what she was doing until I realized that the family cat was coming close, and Lassie was deliberately placing herself in-between the cat and the goslings!</p>

<p>And not too much later, two goslings didn&rsquo;t come home with the rest and I couldn&rsquo;t find them anywhere.
I assumed they were at the creek still and was not going to worry about it. My mother-in-law told me to ask Jack where they were, but I didn&rsquo;t think he would understand.
So, she took it upon herself to ask Jack where they were and followed him right to the empty silo where the goslings had trapped themselves!
It was really neat to see Jack do a classic collie rescue!</p>
