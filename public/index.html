<p>2014 was an eventful year for us at Halcyon Lane Farm, especially concerning the collies. We had our first litter of pups and placed them all into great new homes. We learned so much about our dogs this year as well. One of those lessons was to trust Jack and Lassie more.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting how quickly I jumped to conclusions when one of our dogs exhibited &ldquo;uncharacteristic&rdquo; behavior. Usually the conclusion was to assume Jack or Lassie was misbehaving, when in fact they had a good explanation.</p>

<p>For example, this summer, while we were away from home for a few hours we left Jack on guard duty. He keeps predators away from the flock while we are gone, and also keeps the chickens and geese out of the yard (that way the kids can still play barefoot). Upon our return, we were surprised to see Jack seemingly pinning a chicken down on the yard. We were shocked! Tony yelled from the car, &ldquo;Jack! What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My first thought was that Jack had been overzealous in his guard duty keeping the chickens out of the yard and had injured one. As Jack came over to us, we saw the chicken stumbling around, apparently wounded by Jack. Our son went over to assess the poor chicken&rsquo;s condition, but brought it over to us laughing. String was tangled all around both feet, but other than that the chicken was looking fine and healthy. After we removed the string and waited for the poor bird to realize he was free (chickens are not as smart as Scotch Collies), he walked back to the coop.</p>

<p>Poor Jack! We mistrusted him based on what we saw from a distance instead of giving him the benefit of the doubt. Jack was probably trying to communicate to us, &ldquo;Something is really wrong with this weird chicken,&rdquo; and it certainly needed to be brought to our attention. We changed our tune and Jack became the hero.</p>

<p>Later that summer, Lassie had a similar incident. My oldest son saw her rounding the chicken coop, chasing the ducks and geese, nipping right at their heels. He was very surprised and ran over to see what was happening. Come to find out, our biggest goose had started to chase our younger son, so Lassie was coming to the rescue! She didn&rsquo;t intend to hurt them at all, just teach them a lesson about what the pecking order was around the farm.</p>

<p>Looking back on this year, these are a couple of the lessons that have helped us understand and trust our dogs more. They really have proven that they deserve our trust. They are also showing that they want to understand us better and what we want from them in their role here on the farm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, Anthony Rowley went home to his new family on Sunday. That means all of the pups from our first Jack and Lassie
litter are now home for the holidays. It has been fun to hear from their new owners and we&rsquo;ll continue to watch with interest
as the puppies grow!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;ve really enjoyed having Anthony Rowley these extra few weeks, and haven&rsquo;t made too big of an effort to try and place him. But, he is now 13 weeks old and we know he will be better off getting to his new home sooner rather than later. For the last 3 weeks, we&rsquo;ve been getting to know him really well and are very pleased with his personality. He is very biddable and responds well to a gentle &ldquo;no&rdquo; followed by praise. That is how he has been learning what he can and cannot chew on around the house.</p>

<p>He also loves to hang out with us around the fireplace and will sleep there in the evenings.</p>

<p>He gets that warm, cozy, comfort seeking side from his dam, Lassie. Whereas, Captain Jack is fond of the snow and the cold, Lassie and Anthony Rowley are much quicker to come back in when the playing is finished.</p>

<p>We keep him in a kennel in our room at night, which has been going very well. We hear nary a peep from him from bedtime until we get up in the morning. He has also been traveling with us a few times as we visit family and has done really well.</p>

<p>House training has been going well, and with the other dogs around to help show him where to do his business, it makes things easier.</p>

<p>Let us know if you are interested in this handsome and affectionate little guy!</p>

<p>The puppies are now 8 weeks old, and those not spoken-for are ready to go to new homes!
They have really grown during the past two weeks and are delightfully fun. They&rsquo;re adventurous and playful when outdoors,
mellow and relaxed in-between times, and getting cuter every day!</p>
