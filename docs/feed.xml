<p>It’s been a while since we posted and a lot has happened in those years!</p>

<p>Our biggest change on the farm in that time has been our dogs. Jack and Lassie are both no longer living. They were very special dogs and we have many wonderful memories of them. Now we have two new dogs who are taking on the role of farm helper.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/annie-snow.jpeg" alt="Annie" title="Annie" /></p>

<p>Meet Annie, our female and the older of the two dogs! Annie is four years old now and loves working with the animals, hanging out with us, and playing fetch! We got her from 4J Acres when Lassie died, hoping to be able to have puppies between her and Jack, but unfortunately Jack was unable to breed by the time Annie was old enough.</p>

<p>Picking her up in Texas from 4J Acres was the final adventure of a family vacation we took in 2021. Annie was a little bundle of energy, always wanting to be with us and help in whatever we were doing. But, like a typical Scotch Collie, she also knew how to relax when she didn’t have a job to do. She has grown very well into the role of lead dog on our place.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/annie-puppy.jpeg" alt="Annie" title="Annie" /></p>

<p>Like our other dogs, Annie loves patrolling the farm. She has kept countless hawks and eagles away from the chickens, herds the cows back into their pen if they get out, and keeps the chickens out of the yard and garden. Annie also loves to hunt rodents and goes on point whenever she trees a squirrel. This hunting instinct hasn’t shown itself as distinctly in our other Scotch Collies and is very fun to watch.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/annie-with-cow.jpg" alt="Annie" title="Annie" /></p>

<p>In her “spare time” Annie does have a favorite hobby - playing fetch! She never gets tired of that. But even in the middle of a game, Annie will immediately change into work mode if she sees an eagle anywhere near our chicken coop. We love to watch her running all out to chase it off. Annie loves jumping and climbing over obstacles and we had fun teaching her some agility moves, which she seemed to really enjoy.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/annie-with-cat.jpeg" alt="Annie" title="Annie" /></p>

<p>Even with all her energy, Annie loves to just hang out with us. She is always gentle with the kids too. We’re really looking forward to the time when she has puppies, and if her past behavior is anything to judge by, she will make an excellent mama!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Goodbye Puppies</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/07/17/goodbye-puppies/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Goodbye Puppies" /><published>2017-07-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-07-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/07/17/goodbye-puppies</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/07/17/goodbye-puppies/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/puppies-1-circle.png" alt="Puppies" /></p>

<p>We are a little late in posting, but we said goodbye to all the puppies now, and they are gone to some really great new homes! We were pretty sure this was going to be our last litter by Jack and Lassie and are still leaning that way, but it really is a great experience and so fun to meet people looking for the old time collie. We’ll see what the future holds… 😁</p>

<p>Now we are back to just our two family dogs and that’s a good feeling too :)</p>

<p>It’s getting so close now, for you new puppy owners-to-be. Next week already some puppies will be heading to their new homes and we are really excited about the families they are going to!</p>

<p>But we have some big news! Byron has come available again and is no longer reserved. For personal reasons the previous person had to back out, so we are hoping for another family that may have been wanting a puppy but thought it was too late for this litter. Byron is a sweet and handsome little boy!</p>

<p>It’s amazing how quickly the progression goes from 1st week helpless newborn to 7th week fuzzy bundle of curiosity, action, and affection! We took the puppies for their first car ride and they did really well. They had a great time exploring a new play set and whatever else caught their eye – the knot on a pine tree or a bundle of moss!</p>

<p>Hot summer days, the garden is in, apples are grafted, and puppies are on the run! The weather has been so beautiful, we’ve been taking the puppies outside for extra play times.</p>

<p>It’s so fun to watch them trot around, alert to any changes since the last time they were out. They have some good tussles and play follow-the-leader. One puppy will find an interesting thing to carry around and runs to keep it from the others. After a while, one-by-one the puppies plop down in a cozy spot for a nap. Then we scoop them up and take them back to the house for a long nap.</p>

<p>All the puppies are now reserved, and we’re really excited about the families they are going to. Check out our

<p>Things are going swimmingly with this litter of puppies. They are growing up really fast and we’re getting to the stage where personalities are starting to bloom, which is so fun! The newborn wobbly legs have turned into strong healthy ones that like to wrestle, tackle, jump and run around.</p>

<p>We took these last pictures outside on one of those ideal days: Sunday of Memorial Day weekend with blue skies, white puffy clouds and the family playing croquet out on the front lawn. It was the first time the puppies had extended time to play and romp outside like that. The kids, as always, are doing a great job of giving each pup a lot of TLC. Now that the puppies are older and have more energy we are going to be giving them their daily dose of outside play time.</p>

<p>Four puppies are officially reserved now, and we have a general idea on which ones they are, but still haven’t worked out which puppy goes to which person (if you are one of those people, and you know who you are, we’ll be contacting you soon to finalize).</p>

<p>It’s been a little busier than usual around our place, and getting consensus on names for the puppies has been about as difficult as finding time to post an update of them :)  (Scroll down for pictures)</p>

<p>The puppies have been growing fast and Lassie has been ravenously hungry. Coincidence? I think not. They are 2 weeks old now and their eyes have just started opening for the first time. What an exciting time, wondering what it must be like for them to peek out into this world they’ve only so far smelled, touched and tasted.</p>

<p>It’s a special time for us and our children, because we are pretty sure this will be the last time we breed Jack and Lassie. That’s right, no more Halcyon pups in the forseeable future. We don’t know all the history of Lassie’s past, but she didn’t have an easy life before we found her, and we think this decision will be good for her.</p>

<p>We had 3 accepted applications from our waiting list almost right away, so only 2 pups are left to be reserved. I decided to hold off on reserving the last two for a little while, just to let the dust settle. One of the tricky parts of reserving pups this early is that we don’t know for sure about coat length or personalities, etc.</p>

<p>Without further ado, introducing….</p>

<p>Spring has really sprung here at Halcyon Lane Farm. We’ve been hatching out ducks, turkeys, chickens and geese, waiting for a couple calves, setting up a new beehive, planting fruit trees, <em>and</em> oh yeah, Lassie just had puppies! There are 5 roly-poly cute puppies, 4 sables (2 male, 2 female) and 1 tricolor (female). Everything went well and all the puppies are healthy and thriving.</p>

<p>This is our last week with the puppies before they leave us and head off to their new homes. We are sure going to miss them! At the same time, the pups are very anxious to meet you (you know who you are!) and are practically gift wrapping themselves to get home for Christmas.</p>

<p>This week will be their first visit to the vet, so they can have their clean bill of health before heading out into the world, all full of adventure.</p>

<p>We’ve been giving the pups some daily excursions outside to play. They love getting outside and exploring the sights and smells of the farm as well as making friends with some of the cats.</p>

<p>Captain Jack has not been nearly as terrified of his progeny this litter as he was for his first. He likes to play with the pups a little bit, but Lassie keeps him in line. We are going to miss these little guys but know they are going to some great new homes!</p>

<p>We’ve been having a blast giving so much holding time and attention to all four pups and taking them outside for their first romps. They’ve loved the time outside and it’s great watching them take in all the new scents and sights.</p>

<p>They’ve really seemed to desire our companionship more and more, especially as Lassie is beginning to spend more time away. She’s a good experienced mama, and we go by her pace for when she wants time away or time with the pups.</p>

<p>We’ve introduced toys. It’s hilarious now, just watching them play. Of course, one of them always wants to be sleeping while a couple others trample the sleeper to start some fun.</p>
