<p>Kip was born on an Amish farm about an hour away from us. We were interested in a male puppy at the time, and Kip seemed to fit perfectly for what we wanted. His parents seemed to really fit the Scotch Collie breed, and their litter of puppies looked just like typical Scotch Collie pups.</p>

<p>Even as a puppy, Kip was very people-oriented and would try to help us with whatever we were doing. When we were digging in the garden he would dig too! Kip would also watch our other dogs working around the farm and learned a lot of things from Annie (and some tips on how to behave when he got too playful, from Jack).</p>

<p>Kip has grown up to be a beautiful working dog. He now does many jobs around the farm, from hunting mice and rodents to letting us know when he thinks the kids are doing something he percives as dangereous. He also lets us know if our animals (cows, goats, pigs,) get out of their pens.</p>

<p>Because Amish people in our area don’t believe in registering their animals, Kip and his parents weren’t registered. So we are currently applying for that through the <a href="http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/">Old-Time Scotch Collie Association</a>.</p>
