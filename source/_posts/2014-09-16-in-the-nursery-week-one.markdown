We've decided to go with a Mother Goose nursery rhyme theme for naming this litter of puppies. 
They are looking really healthy and growing fast. A couple have been trying to walk around, which is so hilarious.
Any day now, they should be opening their eyes, and then look out world.

Let's get to know each puppy now, with some pictures and a rhyme!


## Anthony Rowley  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach, "Heigho," says Anthony Rowley!*
