A couple of mornings ago, I thought I heard the kids calling us
when we were out in the barn doing chores. I ran outside to see what 
was going on but the house was quietly sitting there without any sign of 
the children.

Jack and Lassie came running, too. They were not fooled by the sound and I soon realized
I was hearing some coyotes yipping across the road at the neighbors field. 
Jack went running and barking with Lassie close behind trying with all her
might to keep up with him, with only her three paws.
I was worried they would cross their boundary in all the excitement!

Nope! They ran up on the front porch where there was a commanding view and barked until the coyotes 
quieted down. Good job, watch dogs!

We were hoping for puppies this Spring, but it looks like we'll have to wait until next time.
