We took Lassie to the vet two weeks ago and she was diagnosed with puppies!
When Lassie was on the Amish farm, she usually had big litters of 8 to 12 pups.
We'll see if that holds true, and if so, we could be in for a lot of fun around our place.
She is due in early September.

We've been really excited to see how to combination of Jack and Lassie will turn out.
Lassie introduces an entirely new blood line to the [OTSCA](http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/, "Old Time Scotch Collie Association") registry, and she is a really special dog. Jack brings a great pedigree to the mix, so hopefully
there will be some fantastic puppies to share with the Scotch Collie community soon.

To be placed on our puppy waiting list, 
[send us an email](mailto:mindy@halcyonlane.com)
with the subject line "Gotta have one!" and tell us a little about yourself.
