It's been so exciting to see each puppy's personality blossom.
Already I'm seeing so many of the strong Scotch Collie traits that have been part of the breed for centuries. 
As I've spoken with people across the country about these puppies, 
I keep hearing such wonderful stories from your histories, of collies that have 
touched yours or your ancestors' lives. I love being a part of bringing back this wonderful breed!
