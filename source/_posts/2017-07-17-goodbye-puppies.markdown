We are a little late in posting, but we said goodbye to all the puppies now, and they are gone to some really great new homes! We were pretty sure this was going to be our last litter by Jack and Lassie and are still leaning that way, but it really is a great experience and so fun to meet people looking for the old time collie. We'll see what the future holds... üòÅ

Now we are back to just our two family dogs and that's a good feeling too :)
