![Puppies](/images/puppies-1-circle.png "Puppies")

The past two weeks have brought so many changes to the puppies, and it is amazing to 
watch it all happen day by day. Their eyes have opened, they've begun to walk around,
and their noses have already begun to darken. We've also been seeing personalities come out
in each of the pups as they start to play with each other and with us 
(they get A LOT of attention from us and our children).

We are accepting applications for adoption now. 
<a href="mailto:mindy@halcyonlane.com">Email us</a>
to get the process started,
or just to chat about the puppies. 
If you have your eye on a particular one, choice is normally given in 
the order reservations are made.
