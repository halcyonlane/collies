This is the story of how we came to find and buy Lassie from a local Amish family here in Wisconsin.

It all started when I was reading about Scotch Collies for the first time.
I was reminded of a farm dog I had seen while visiting a local Amish business (located on their farm). 
Something about the dog's affection and understanding of her master stuck with me. 
I left a message with them later that I was interested in getting a dog like they had.

A couple of months later I saw an ad in our rural newspaper advertising collie/heeler puppies 
and only listed an address. This usually means they are Amish. 
Hoping to see the dog that made up the collie part, I decided to drive out to see the puppies. 
As soon as I saw Lassie, I thought Scotch Collie.
I was told that the father of the puppies was the neighbor's heeler. 
They had named her Lassie after the book (of course). 
When asked if Lassie herds any animals around the farm, I was told, "Oh yeah, she brings the cows in." 
On their farm they had 8 or so milk cows and raised layer chickens, along with a pony and I'm not sure what else. 
Their children were all young, so I knew Lassie was used to kids!

They didn't know anything of Lassie's background, just that "someone in our community raises them." I was very
intrigued about Lassie after that visit. She lingered in my mind as a potential Scotch Collie. 
A few weeks later we were on our way to Missouri to pick up Captain Jack. Lassie remained in the back of my mind,
but now we had our own Scotch Collie puppy and he was our main focus.

About a year later I stopped by to see Lassie and talk with her owners about a possible breeding with Captain Jack. 
We really didn't want to breed Jack yet, but wanted to see if they were receptive to the idea of the pairing. Lassie had another
litter of heeler puppies when we stopped out again, so we thought we could get a word in for Jack.

After thinking things over, we decided to pursue a purchase of Lassie and bring her to Halcyon Lane Farm. I hated to even mention it to 
Lassie's owners, since she was their family dog, but when I did they were receptive to the idea. Lassie is missing her left hind foot,
which we found out was from a hay cutting accident (yikes!). This, coupled with the fact that she was getting "older"
(we found out later that she was only 4 years old) persuaded them to sell Lassie to us! 

We arranged to pick her up the following Saturday and brought her home. That was September 28th, 2013 and Captain Jack was now over a year old.
It happened to be chicken butchering day on the farm, so both Lassie and Jack had their fill of gizzards and livers by the end of the day.

Lassie really seemed to accept her new home and us as her new family. She has been really great with the kids. She does well with our free range
chickens, likes to help herd our family cow and calf, and plays nice with the family cats. She and Captain Jack are great
friends, too.

This January, 2014, Lassie came into heat so we are hoping to have a litter of puppies coming in March.
