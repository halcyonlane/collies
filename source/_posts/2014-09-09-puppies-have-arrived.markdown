Announcing, born to Heritage Captain Jack and Halcyon Amish Lassie,
 on Sunday September 7th, lots of puppies. They were born all through the 
night Sunday and into Monday morning, ending up with 9 puppies overall.

There are 6 females and 3 males, all with gorgeous sausage-like bodies. 
They look so healthy and chubby! Our children will be holding these puppies
a lot. Lassie does not seem to mind us being around and holding some 
puppies now and then, but when she is outside for a break,
 we all pounce and scoop them up for holding time.

Here is a picture (more to follow) with Lassie and the pups:

As soon as we decide on names we will send in our litter registration to the
[Old-Time Scotch Collie Association](http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/ "Old-Time Scotch Collie Association").
