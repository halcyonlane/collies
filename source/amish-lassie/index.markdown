We purchased 
[Amish Lassie](http://www.scotchcollie.org/registry/browser.php?id=63793 "Halcyon Amish Lassie")
from a local Amish family in September of 2013. She is provisionally registered with the
[OTSCA](http://www.scotchcollie.org/club/ "Old-Time Scotch Collie Association").
We are really excited about finding Lassie and pairing her up with 
[Captain Jack](/captain-jack "Heritage Captain Jack")
. It's looking like Lassie will be having a litter of puppies for us soon.
[Captain Jack](/captain-jack "Heritage Captain Jack")
and Lassie get along really well and it's fun to see them running around the farm together.
