We started looking at Scotch Collies in 2012 after we moved to Halcyon Lane Farm. 
[Captain Jack](http://www.scotchcollie.org/registry/browser.php?id=63740 "Heritage Captain Jack")
is one of the
[Heritage](http://heritage.scotchcollie.org "Heritage Kennels")
dogs
and we were really excited to get in on a litter from 
[Lassen](http://www.scotchcollie.org/registry/browser.php?id=63528 "Heritage Little Lassen")
and 
[Rainier](http://www.scotchcollie.org/registry/browser.php?id=63492 "Heritage Mighty Rainier")
. 

It was an adventure getting Captain Jack in August of 2012 when we made a trip to Missouri as part of a "puppy train"
that started in Arizona and ended in Michigan.
