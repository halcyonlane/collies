Now we've been training Jack to keep the goslings out of the back yard. He is very enthusiastic about helping, but as soon as the goslings are out of the yard, he doesn't even wait for my "That'll do" to come back toward me, since he knows his job is done. I think Jack's highest motivator is praise from us. When he does a good job he gives his collie smile and soaks in his reward.

When the goslings were still quite small yet, we were putting them in their ranging pen. I noticed Lassie, who had been lying nearby, get up and move a couple of feet over, then lie down. Then she did it again. I couldn't figure out what she was doing until I realized that the family cat was coming close, and Lassie was deliberately placing herself in between the cat and the goslings!

Also, we can talk about the lost goslings. And maybe give an update on puppies.
