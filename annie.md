We really missed Lassie after she died in 2021, and decided to start looking for a new Scotch Collie female. Over the years, from when I first learned about Scotch Collies, I really admired the 4J Acres dogs - their bloodlines and looks, as well as their breeding program. But, driving to Texas from Wisconsin to pick up a pup was never really an option for us. Almost impossibly, it seemed, 4J Acres had a litter of puppies (with strong Sojourner lines!) that would be ready to go, right when we would be driving near (okay, well, 5 hours away, in Arkansas), finishing up our 4313 mile family road trip vacation. Picking Annie up was the highlight of the trip! 

From a cute and adorable puppy, Annie has grown into a beautiful and remarkable dog. We frequently have guests mention how not only how beautiful she is, but on her wonderful personality as well. Annie loves looking after the farm, especially keeping predators away from the chickens and helping herd any escaped animals back to their pens. She keeps an eye out for varmints as well. She loves playing fetch with anyone who will throw a stick or ball for her!  

Annie's full name is 4J Acres Sojourner Lucy Anne and she is registered with the Old Time Scotch Collie Association. [Click here to see her pedigree.](https://registry.scotchcollie.org/details.php?id=66945)
