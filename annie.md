When our dog Lassie died, we started looking for a new female and found Annie! From 4J Acres in Texas, picking her up was a highlight of a family vacation we took in 2021. from a cute and adorable puppy, she has grown up into a beautifull and remarkable dog.

She also loves playing fetch with anyone who will throw a stick or ball for her. Read more about Annie
